## Common Security Vulnerabilities

### Injection Attacks
- SQL injection in database queries
- Command injection in system calls
- LDAP injection in directory queries
- NoSQL injection in document databases

### Authentication Issues
- Weak password policies
- Missing multi-factor authentication
- Session fixation vulnerabilities
- Insecure password storage

### Authorization Problems
- Missing access controls
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Insecure direct object references
- Function-level access control bypass

### Data Exposure
- Sensitive data in logs
- Information disclosure in error messages
- Unencrypted sensitive data storage
- Inadequate data transmission protection

### Cryptographic Issues
- Weak encryption algorithms
- Insecure key management
- Poor random number generation
- Improper certificate validation

## Security Testing Recommendations

### Static Analysis
- Code scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection in code
- Security linting rules

### Dynamic Testing
- Penetration testing scenarios
- Fuzzing for input validation
- Authentication/authorization testing
- Error handling validation

### Compliance Checks
- OWASP Top 10 coverage
- Industry-specific compliance (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)
- Security framework alignment
- Data protection requirements

## Integration Security

### API Security
- Rate limiting implementation
- API authentication mechanisms
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Response security headers

### Database Security
- Connection string protection
- Database access controls
- Encryption at rest
- Audit logging

### Third-Party Integrations
- Secure API communication
- Vendor security assessment
- Data sharing agreements
- Integration access controls

## Context Integration
This command considers project-specific security requirements from CLAUDE.md:
- Domain-specific compliance requirements
- Technology stack security patterns
- Integration security needs
- Performance vs security trade-offs

Security reviews are tailored to the specific threat model and compliance requirements of the project domain.
