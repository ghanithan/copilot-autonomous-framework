# Getting Started with Copilot Autonomous Development Framework

This guide will walk you through setting up and using the framework to enable GitHub Copilot for autonomous development.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Access to a GitHub repository where you want to implement autonomous development

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Framework

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/copilot-autonomous-framework.git
cd copilot-autonomous-framework
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
python generators/generate-copilot-config.py --help
```

You should see the help message for the configuration generator.

## Creating Your First Configuration

### Step 1: Choose a Template

The framework provides several example configurations:

- **E-commerce Platform** (`examples/ecommerce-platform.yml`): Rust backend with React frontend
- **SaaS Dashboard** (`examples/saas-dashboard.yml`): Python FastAPI with React frontend

Copy an example that matches your technology stack:

```bash
cp examples/ecommerce-platform.yml my-project-config.yml
```

### Step 2: Customize the Configuration

Edit `my-project-config.yml` to match your project:

```yaml
project:
  name: "Your Project Name"
  description: "Brief description of your project"
  mission: "What problem does your project solve?"

documents:
  prd_reference: "docs/your-prd.md"
  technical_spec_reference: "docs/your-tech-spec.md"

stack:
  backend:
    language: "rust"  # or "python", "node"
    framework: "axum"  # or "fastapi", "express"
  frontend:
    language: "typescript"
    framework: "react"  # or "vue", "angular"
```

Key sections to customize:

#### Project Information
- `name`: Your project name
- `description`: Brief project description
- `mission`: Project goal or problem being solved
- `domain_context`: Domain-specific terminology and concepts

#### Reference Documents
- `prd_reference`: Path to your Product Requirements Document
- `technical_spec_reference`: Path to your technical specification
- `api_reference`: Path to API documentation (optional)

#### Technology Stack
- `backend.language`: Programming language (rust, python, node)
- `backend.framework`: Backend framework (axum, fastapi, express)
- `frontend.framework`: Frontend framework (react, vue, angular)

#### Performance Requirements
```yaml
performance:
  targets:
    - metric: "api_response_time"
      target: "200ms"
      context: "typical API operations"
```

### Step 3: Generate Copilot Configuration

Run the generator to create GitHub Copilot configuration files:

```bash
python generators/generate-copilot-config.py my-project-config.yml --output /path/to/your/project
```

This creates four files in your project:

1. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - Development guidelines and coding standards
2. **`.github/copilot-context.md`** - Project context and domain knowledge
3. **`.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml`** - Environment setup automation
4. **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/copilot-autonomous-task.md`** - Issue template for autonomous tasks

### Step 4: Validate the Configuration

Check that all files were generated correctly:

```bash
ls -la /path/to/your/project/.github/
ls -la /path/to/your/project/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
```

You should see the four generated files.

## Creating Your First Autonomous Task

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Issue

In your GitHub repository, create a new issue using the generated template:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Issues" → "New Issue"
3. Select "Copilot Autonomous Development Task"
4. Fill out the template with specific requirements

### Step 2: Follow the Template Structure

The generated issue template includes:

```markdown
## Problem Description
Clear description of what needs to be implemented

## Context from PRD
Reference to your project documents

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable requirements
- [ ] Performance targets
- [ ] Test coverage requirements

## Files to Create/Modify
Explicit list of files to work on

## Architecture Requirements
Clean Architecture compliance checklist

## Definition of Done
Quality gates and validation steps
```

### Step 3: Assign to GitHub Copilot

Once you have a well-defined issue:

1. Add labels: `copilot-task`, `autonomous-development`
2. Assign the issue to GitHub Copilot (when available)
3. Copilot will use the generated configuration files for context

## Understanding the Generated Files

### `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

This file contains:
- **Architecture principles**: Clean Architecture rules and SOLID principles
- **Coding conventions**: Language-specific standards and naming conventions
- **Performance requirements**: Specific benchmarks and optimization strategies
- **Testing standards**: Coverage requirements and testing frameworks
- **Error handling patterns**: How to handle and report errors

### `.github/copilot-context.md`

This file provides:
- **Project overview**: Mission, description, and value proposition
- **Target users**: Who will use the software
- **Technical architecture**: Technology stack and architectural decisions
- **Clean Architecture layers**: Entities, use cases, adapters, frameworks
- **Development timeline**: Project phases and milestones

### `.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml`

This file includes:
- **Environment setup**: Prerequisites and installation steps
- **Build verification**: Commands to verify the build system
- **Testing**: How to run tests and benchmarks
- **Quality validation**: Architecture compliance and code quality checks

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Issues Focused

Each issue should focus on a single feature or module:
- ✅ "Implement user authentication with JWT tokens"
- ❌ "Implement entire user management system"

### 2. Provide Specific Acceptance Criteria

Use measurable, testable criteria:
- ✅ "API response time <200ms for user login"
- ❌ "Make login fast"

### 3. Reference Architecture Layers

Be explicit about which Clean Architecture layer:
- **Entities**: Core business models
- **Use Cases**: Application business rules
- **Adapters**: Interface adapters (controllers, gateways)
- **Frameworks**: External concerns (web framework, database)

### 4. Include Performance Requirements

Specify measurable performance targets:
```yaml
performance:
  targets:
    - metric: "database_query_time"
      target: "50ms"
      context: "complex joins with 1M+ records"
```

### 5. Validate Generated Code

Always run the quality validation commands:
```bash
# Example for Rust projects
cargo check && cargo test && cargo bench
cargo tarpaulin --out Xml
cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Not Loading

If the generator can't find your configuration:
1. Check the file path is correct
2. Verify YAML syntax with `python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config.yml'))"`
3. Ensure all required sections are present

### Template Variables Not Substituted

If you see `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` in generated files:
1. Check that the variable is defined in your configuration
2. Verify the variable name matches the template exactly
3. Some variables are computed from other values automatically

### Missing Technology Stack Configuration

If your technology stack isn't supported:
1. Check existing configurations in `configs/`
2. Create a new configuration file following the same pattern
3. Reference it in your project configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Create Your First Issue**: Use the generated template to create a focused, autonomous task
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch how Copilot implements the feature following your guidelines
3. **Iterate and Improve**: Refine your configuration based on results
4. **Scale Up**: Create multiple issues for larger features
5. **Contribute Back**: Share your technology stack configurations with the community

## Getting Help

- **Framework Issues**: Create an issue in the framework repository
- **Configuration Questions**: Check existing examples and documentation
- **Technology Stack Support**: Contribute new configurations or request support
